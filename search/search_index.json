Microwaves and optical images with different spatial and temporal resolutions are available and are used to monitor a variety of environmental issues such as deforestation, land degradation, land use and land cover change, among others. Although there are efforts (i.e., Python packages, forums, communities, etc.) to make available line-of-code tools for pre-processing, processing and analysis of satellite imagery, there is still a gap that needs to be filled. In other words, too much time is still spent by many users developing Python lines of code. Algorithms for mapping land degradation through a linear trend of vegetation indices, fusion optical and radar images to classify vegetation cover, and calibration of machine learning algorithms, among others, are not available yet. Therefore, scikit-eo is a Python package that provides tools for remote sensing. This package was developed to fill the gaps in remotely sensed data processing tools. Most of the tools are based on scientific publications, and others are useful algorithms that will allow processing to be done in a few lines of code. With these tools, the user will be able to invest time in analyzing the results of their data and not spend time on elaborating lines of code, which can sometimes be stressful. Audience \u00b6 Scikit-eo is a versatile Python package designed to cover a wide range of users, including students, professionals of remote sensing, researchers of environmental analysis, and organizations looking for satellite image analysis. Its comprehensive features make it well-suited for various applications, such as university teaching, that include technical and practical sessions, and cutting-edge research using the most recent machine learning and deep learning techniques applied to the field of remote sensing. Whether the user are students seeking to get insights from a satellite image analysis or a experienced researcher looking for advanced tools, scikit-eo offers a valuable resource to support the most valuable methods for environmental studies.

Four types of land cover will be mapped, i.e., agriculture, forest, bare soil and water. The input data needed is the satellite image and the spectral signatures collected. The output as a dictionary will provide: i) confusion matrix, ii) overall accuracy, iii) kappa index and iv) a classes map. 01.

To deal with this, users can apply the calibration methods Leave One Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV), Cross-Validation (CV) and Monte Carlo Cross-Validation (MCCV) in order to calibrate a supervised classification with different algorithms. The input data needed are the spectral signatures collected as a .dbf or .csv . The output will provide a graph with the errors of each classifier obtained. 01. Endmembers as a .dbf \u00b6 1 2 path_endm = \"\\data\\ex_O2 \\\\ endmembers\\endmembers.dbf\" endm = DBF ( path_endm ) 02. An instance of calmla() \u00b6 1 inst = calmla ( endmembers = endm ) 03. Applying the splitData() method \u00b6 1 data = inst . splitData () Calibrating with Monte Carlo Cross-Validation Calibration (MCCV) Parameters : split_data : An instance obtaind with splitData() . models : Support Vector Machine (svm), Decision Tree (dt), Random Forest (rf) and Naive Bayes (nb). n_iter : Number of iterations. 04. Running MCCV \u00b6 1 2 error_mccv = inst . MCCV ( split_data = data , models = ( 'svm' , 'dt' , 'rf' , 'nb' ), n_iter = 10 ) Calibration results: With this result it can be observed that SVM and RF obtained a higher overall accuracy (less error). Therefore, you can use these algorithms to classify a satellite image. Example 03: Imagery Fusion - optical/radar \u00b6 This is an area where scikit-eo provides a novel approach to merge different types of satellite imagery. We are in a case where, after combining different variables into a single output, we want to know the contributions of the different original variables in the data fusion. The fusion of radar and optical images, despite of its well-know use, to improve land cover mapping, currently has no tools that help researchers to integrate or combine those resources. In this third example, users can apply imagery fusion with different observation geometries and different ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum (Tarazona et al., 2021) . The input data needed are the optical satellite image and the radar satellite image, for instance. In scikit-eo we developed the function fusionrs() which provides us with a dictionary with the following image fusion interpretation features: Fused_images : The fusion of both images into a 3-dimensional array (rows, cols, bands). Variance : The variance obtained. Proportion_of_variance : The proportion of the obtained variance. Cumulative_variance : The cumulative variance. Correlation : Correlation of the original bands with the principal components. Contributions_in_% : The contributions of each optical and radar band in the fusion. 01. Loagind dataset \u00b6 Loading a radar and optical imagery with a total of 9 bands. Optical imagery has 6 bands Blue, Green, Red, NIR, SWIR1 and SWIR2, while radar imagery has 3 bandas VV, VH and VV/VH. 1 2 3 4 5 path_optical = \"data/ex_03/LC08_003069_20180906.tif\" optical = rasterio . open ( path_optical ) path_radar = \"data/ex_03/S1_2018_VV_VH.tif\" radar = rasterio . open ( path_radar ) 02. Applying the fusionrs: \u00b6 1 fusion = fusionrs ( optical = optical , radar = radar ) 03. Dictionary of results: \u00b6 1 fusion . keys () 04. Proportion of variance: \u00b6 1 prop_var = fusion . get ( 'Proportion_of_variance' ) 05. Cumulative variance (%): \u00b6 1 cum_var = fusion . get ( 'Cumulative_variance' ) * 100 06. Showing the proportion of variance and cumulative: \u00b6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 x_labels = [ 'PC {} ' . format ( i + 1 ) for i in range ( len ( prop_var ))] fig , axes = plt . subplots ( figsize = ( 6 , 5 )) ln1 = axes . plot ( x_labels , prop_var , marker = 'o' , markersize = 6 , label = 'Proportion of variance' ) axes2 = axes . twinx () ln2 = axes2 . plot ( x_labels , cum_var , marker = 'o' , color = 'r' , label = \"Cumulative variance\" ) ln = ln1 + ln2 labs = [ l . get_label () for l in ln ] axes . legend ( ln , labs , loc = 'center right' ) axes . set_xlabel ( \"Principal Component\" ) axes . set_ylabel ( \"Proportion of Variance\" ) axes2 . set_ylabel ( \"Cumulative (%)\" ) axes2 . grid ( False ) plt . show () 07. Contributions of each variable in %: \u00b6 1 fusion . get ( 'Contributions_in_%' ) Here, var1 , var2 , ... var12 refer to Blue , Green , ... VV/VH bands respectively. It can be observed that var2 (Green) has a higher contribution percentage 16.9% than other variables. With respect to radar polarizaciones, we can note that var8 (VH polarization) has a higher contribution 11.8% than other radar bands. 08. Preparing the image: \u00b6 1 2 3 4 5 6 arr = fusion . get ( 'Fused_images' ) ## Let\u00b4s plot fig , axes = plt . subplots ( figsize = ( 8 , 8 )) plotRGB ( arr , bands = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ], title = 'Fusion of optical and radar images' ) plt . show () Example 04: Confusion matrix by estimated proportions of area with a confidence interval at 95% (1.96) \u00b6 In this final example, after obtaining the predicted class map, we are in a case where we want to know the uncertainties of each class. The assessing accuracy and area estimate will be obtained following guidance proposed by (Olofsson et al., 2014) . All that users need are the confusion matrix and a previously obtained predicted class map. confintervalML requires the following parameters: matrix : confusion matrix or error matrix in numpy.ndarray. image_pred : a 2-dimensional array (rows, cols). This array should be the classified image with predicted classes. pixel_size : Pixel size of the classified image. Set by default as 10 meters. In this example is 30 meters (Landsat). conf : Confidence interval. By default is 95% (1.96). nodata : No data must be specified as 0, NaN or any other value.

Variables that are correlated with PC1 (i.e., Dim.1) and PC2 (i.e., Dim.2) are the most important in explaining the variability in the data set. Variables that do not correlated with any PC or correlated with the last dimensions are variables with low contribution and might be removed to simplify the overall analysis. The contribution is a scaled version of the squared correlation between variables and component axes (or the cosine, from a geometrical point of view) --- this is used to assess the quality of the representation of the variables of the principal component, and it is computed as (cos(variable,axis)^2/total cos2 of the component)\u00d7100.
