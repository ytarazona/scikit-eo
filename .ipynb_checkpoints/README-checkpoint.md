# Introduction

Now a day, remotely sensed data has increased dramatically. Microwaves and optical images with different spatial and temporal resolutions are available and are using to monitor a variaty of environmental issues such as deforestation, land degradation, crop classifications, among other. Although there are efforts (i.e., Python packages, forums, communities, etc.) to make available line-of-code tools for pre-processing, processing and analysis of satellite imagery, there is still a gap that needs to be filled. In other words, too much time is still spent by many users in developing Python lines of code. Algorithms for mapping land degradation through linear trend of vegetation indices (Tarazona and Miyasiro, 2021), fusion optical and radar images to classify vegetation cover, calibration of machine learning lagorithms, among others, are not available yet.

Therefore, **scikit-eo** is a Python package that provides tools for remote sensing. This package was developed to fill the gaps in remotely sensed data processing tools. Most of the tools are based on scientific publications, and others are useful algorithms that will allow processing to be done in a few lines of code. With these tools, the user will be able to invest time in analyzing the results of their data and not spend time on elaborating lines of code, which can sometimes be stressful.

# Tools for Remote Sensing

| Name of functions  | Description|
| -------------------| --------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`mla`**          | Machine Learning                                                          |

| **`calkmeans`**    | This function allows to calibrate the kmeans algorithm. It is possible to obtain the best k value and the best embedded algorithm in kmeans.                               |
| **`pca`**          | Principal Components Analysis                                             |

| **`deepLearning`** | Deep Learning algorithms                                                  |
| **`linearTrend`**  | Linear trend is useful for mapping forest degradation or land degradation |
| **`fusionrs`**     | This algorithm allows to fusion images coming from different spectral sensors (e.g., optical-optical, optical and SAR or SAR-SAR). Among many of the qualities of this function, it is possible to obtain the contribution (%) of each variable in the fused image |
| **`sma`**          | Spectral Mixture Analysis - Classification sup-pixel                      |
| **`tassCap`**      | The Tasseled-Cap Transformation                                           |

# Installation

To use **scikit-eo** it is necessary to install it. There are two options:

## 1. From PyPI

**scikit-eo** is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/scikeo/), so to install it, run this command in your terminal:

```python
pip install scikeo
```

## 2. Installing from source

It is also possible to install the latest development version directly from the GitHub repository with:

```python
pip install git+https://github.com/ytarazona/scikit-eo
```

# Example

## 1. Applying Machine Learning

Libraries to be used:

```python
import rasterio
import numpy as np
from scikeo.mla import MLA
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from dbfread import DBF
import matplotlib as mpl
import pandas as pd
```

## 2.0 Optical image


Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) will be used to obtain in order to classify using Random Forest (RF). This image, which is in surface reflectance with bands:
- Blue -> B2
- Green -> B3 
- Red -> B4
- Nir -> B5
- Swir1 -> B6
- Swir2 -> B7

The image and signatures to be used can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/193RhNpACu9THcOZu8OzMh-btnFCOgHrU?usp=sharing):


## 3.0 Supervised Classification using Random Forest

Image and endmembers

```python
path_raster = r"C:\data\ml\LC08_232066_20190727_SR.tif"
img = rasterio.open(path_raster)

path_endm = r"C:\data\ml\endmembers.dbf"
endm = DBF(path_endm)
```

```python
# endmembers
df = pd.DataFrame(iter(endm))
df.head()
```

</a>
</p>


Instance of ```mla()```:

```python
inst = MLA(image = img, endmembers = endm)
```

Applying Random Forest:

```python
rf_class = inst.SVM(training_split = 0.7)
```

## 4.0 Results

Dictionary of results

```python
rf_class.keys()
```

Overall accuracy

```python
rf_class.get('Overall_Accuracy')
```

Kappa index

```python
rf_class.get('Kappa_Index')
```

Confusion matrix or error matrix

```python
rf_class.get('Confusion_Matrix')
```

Preparing the image before plotting

```python
# convert to array
arr_img = img.read()
# stacking the image
rgb = np.stack([arr_img[4,:,:], arr_img[3,:,:], arr_img[2,:,:]], axis = -1)

# Normalizing bands
def stretch_std(arr, std_val):
    """ Returns the data with a standard deviation contrast applied """
    mean = np.mean(arr)
    std = np.std(arr)*std_val
    min_val = np.max([mean - std, np.min(arr)])
    max_val = np.min([mean + std, np.max(arr)])
    clipped_arr = np.clip(arr, min_val, max_val)
    img = (clipped_arr - min_val)/(max_val - min_val)
    return img

rgb_norm = stretch_std(rgb, 2.5)
```

```python
# Let's define the color palette
palette = mpl.colors.ListedColormap(["#2232F9","#F922AE","#229954","#7CED5E"])

# LetÂ´s plot
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows = 1, ncols = 2, figsize = (15, 9))
axes[0].imshow(rgb_norm)
axes[0].set_title("Image in Surface Reflectance")
axes[0].grid(False)

axes[1].imshow(rf_class.get('Classification_Map'), cmap = palette)
axes[1].set_title("Classification Map")
axes[1].grid(False)
```
